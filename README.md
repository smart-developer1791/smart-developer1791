# About Me

👋 Hi! I'm a **Fullstack Developer** with over **10 years of experience** creating, maintaining, and optimizing web projects — from landing pages and e-commerce stores to complex SPAs and corporate platforms.

Most of my experience comes from **freelance work**, which exposed me to a wide variety of tasks — from simple to high-load complex projects. Working with different **CMS, integrations, internal tools, and web services** strengthened my skills, architecture approach, and systemic vision. Even in company environments, I applied and honed these skills, but freelance gave me the most depth and diversity of experience.
